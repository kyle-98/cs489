                During this term the creation of the first game has been completed.  The game is Flappy Bird, which was a popular mobile game around 2014-2015.
                In making this game from scratch the skills learned duing term 1 and term 2 have been used and shown in the making of the game.  
                At the end of this paragprah there is a link to the full summary of term 2 as a pdf file better explaining in detail all of the research done.

                <b>Mid Term:</b><br><br>
               This term is a summary that includes all previous research and the research done over the past 2 weeks.
               During the past two weeks the game Pong was created with the capability of AI in the game therefore the player
               can play against the game itself.  The AI is very simple, but is the foundation for the final game of the research project.
