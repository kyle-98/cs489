    <h1>Overview and Information</h1>
    <div class="info">
        <p class="genInfo">This research project consists of learning and exploring PyGame.  This is a library built for designing simplistic games in Python.  
            This project consists of a few simple games made in the PyGame library.  These games can be used for entertainment purposes as well as a use to 
            learn and better understand integrating imported libraries to Python projects.
            <br><br>
            Each of the games compounds the knowledge that was learned for the previous one to be built.  Each game is more refined behind the scenes in the source
            code.  This allows each game to be more polished than the previous one.  This also allows for the knowledge that has been learned to be used throughout the entire
            project as well.

        <br><br><br><br>

            All information about PyGame is found on their website and their GitHub. This includes how to install and all the documentation for the modules.
