            <p1>The test game which was the foundation for research for this project was snake.  This 
                is a very basic game in which the player can control a snake around a board.  In this the player
                tries to pick up food that is randomly spawned around the map.  The score increases as the player 
                "eats" the food.  This game allowed for learning the foundational components of PyGame that was/were 
                used in later games in this project.  This game is very bare-bones of a project
                thus does not have much detail in the art, style, and gameplay of the game.
